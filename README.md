# Binary Files

This is a hodgepodge of binary files to de-clutter other git repos of unnecessary storage.

# Access files

To de-clutter and speed up downloads, each unique item may be added to their own branch. To clone a specific branch use:

```
git clone -b <branch> --single-branch https://github.com/cdgriffith/binary-files.git
```


# Staying Legal 

Required license files or attributes can be found in the same directory hierarchy as their binaries in README, COPYING or LICENSE files.
